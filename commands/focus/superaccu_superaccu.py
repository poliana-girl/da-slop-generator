#  Usage
# superaccu superaccu 1 inanalysisfile outanalysisfile [-ddecay] [-gglis] [-r]
# superaccu superaccu 2 inanalysisfile outanalysisfile [-ddecay] [-gglis] [-r]


# Example command line to sustain until louder data is present:

#     superaccu superaccu 3 rasp.ana raspsuperaccu.ana supaccutune.txt -d0.5 -g0.9
#     (supaccutune.txt: 60 63 67 70 73) (This example seemed to produce rather too much 'resonant tail' â€“ the last 10 seconds were inaudible; the input file was 10 seconds long. So you may need to CUT some of the latter part of the output analysis file with SPEC CUT.) 

# Modes

#     1  Operates like FOCUS ACCU
#     2  Forces the (start of) resonances to the tempered scale
